\section*{Personal qualities}
I enjoy working out on my spare time and will consider it a big advantage if my employer offers a health center. I also enjoy being social with friends, watch movies and play video games. I also have an interest in stock trading and I strongly believe that money should be invested, before it is gone.

I am committed and dedicated to any task I am assigned. I can work under pressure, independently or in a group. I am imaginative and creative as well as competent. I like to work methodical and I like well structured and complete solutions.

I speak fluent Swedish and English.
